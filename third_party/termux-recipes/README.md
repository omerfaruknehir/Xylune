# Retained Termux recipes

These files are retained as build provenance for the exact Termux packages
whose binaries Turp redistributes. They are historical upstream recipes, not
Turp's authoritative license classification.

In particular, `libtalloc-build.sh` labels the complete talloc source package
as GPL-3.0. The pinned talloc 2.4.3 archive also contains GPL-only ancillary
Python/test files, but its `LICENSE`, `talloc.c`, and `talloc.h` identify the
shared C library shipped by Turp as LGPL-3.0-or-later.

Do not edit a retained recipe merely to make its metadata agree with Turp's
binary-level notice. Update `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md` and the provenance verifier
when a packaged component or source archive changes.
