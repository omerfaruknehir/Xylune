# CI signing

`turp-debug.keystore` is an intentionally public Android debug key. It signs only the installable test build with package ID `app.turp.chat`, giving local and GitHub Actions builds a stable signer so one debug release can update another.

It is not a secret and must never be used for the production package. Store builds use a separate protected release key configured through the `TURP_KEYSTORE_*` values documented in [BUILDING.md](../BUILDING.md).
