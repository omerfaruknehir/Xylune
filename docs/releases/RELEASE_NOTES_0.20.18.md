# Turp 0.20.18

## Fixed

- The Turp mark in the navigation drawer now uses the exact same palette-specific artwork as the selected launcher icon.
- The Turp entry in Offline licenses follows the active launcher icon instead of staying on the default green asset.
- Launcher icon changes are applied by a dedicated lightweight process, insulating the foreground app task from OEM component-toggle restarts.
- Completed user messages no longer remain stuck showing only an early prefix while their full source is still available in Edit.
