# Turp 0.23.2

This hotfix repairs cloud restore and replaces generic provider placeholders in the first-run restore screen.

## Fixed

- OneDrive, Dropbox, WebDAV/Nextcloud, and S3-compatible backups can now be downloaded, inspected, and imported. Their downloaded archive directory is explicitly exposed through Turp's private FileProvider.
- The restore action is labeled **Review & restore** so selecting a backup clearly opens the archive summary before import.
- Restore failures remain in the cloud dialog with the provider error instead of silently appearing to do nothing.

## Interface

- Google Drive, OneDrive, Dropbox, and Nextcloud/WebDAV now use recognizable provider marks.
- S3-compatible storage uses a neutral storage icon because it may refer to AWS S3, Cloudflare R2, Backblaze B2, MinIO, or another compatible service.

The package remains `app.turp.chat` and the public update-compatible signing certificate is unchanged.

## Branding and provider artwork

- Replaced the former A-derived artwork throughout the app with the approved Turp X-and-leaf logo from `branding/turp-logo.svg`.
- Preserved Turp, Dynamic, Graphite, Ocean, Violet, and Sunset color schemes while making every adaptive, monochrome, and in-app mark use one normalized geometry.
- Fixed the Dynamic launcher icon occasionally appearing at a different scale by aligning base and Android 12+ resources to the same viewport and paths.
- Updated cloud restore to the supplied current Google Drive, Microsoft OneDrive, Dropbox, and Nextcloud marks.
